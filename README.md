# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-Combining-CNN-RNN-Regression-and-Regularization
A machine learning project to predict Airbnb rental prices using a multimodal approach: CNN for image analysis of property photos, RNN for processing user reviews, and regression for structured data (e.g., location, amenities). Regularization techniques (Dropout, L2, Early Stopping) improve model robustness.
